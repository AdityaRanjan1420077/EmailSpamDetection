Email Spam Detection Using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on building an Email Spam Detection system using Machine Learning algorithms. The system is designed to classify emails as either spam or ham (non-spam) by analyzing their content. Spam emails can pose security threats and reduce productivity, so automating the detection process is crucial.

In this project, we'll use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify emails. The dataset used contains labeled email data with features such as subject, body, and header information.

Dataset
The dataset used is the SMS Spam Collection Dataset, which contains a labeled set of emails with a spam/ham label. This can be downloaded from popular sources like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

Data Columns:
Label: Spam or Ham
Email Body: Text of the email
Approach
Data Preprocessing:

Remove stop words, punctuation, and numbers.
Convert text to lowercase.
Apply tokenization and stemming/lemmatization.
Feature Engineering:

Use TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorizer to convert text data into numerical vectors.
Model Training:

Train models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and SVM using the preprocessed data.
Tune hyperparameters for optimal performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the performance of models using a test dataset.
Compare metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Evaluation
Models will be evaluated based on the following metrics:

Accuracy: Overall correctness of the model.
Precision: Proportion of predicted positive cases that are actually positive.
Recall: Proportion of actual positive cases that are predicted positive.
F1-Score: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balanced metric.
Conclusion
The Email Spam Detection system uses a combination of NLP techniques and machine learning models to accurately detect spam emails. With the implemented approach, the system achieves robust performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

Future Work
Integrate deep learning methods such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) or LSTM to further improve classification performance.
Add support for multi-language email spam detection.
Implement an automated pipeline for continuous training with new email data.
